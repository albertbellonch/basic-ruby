#Â Define a class with two instance methods that, given a collection
# of strings which is an instance variable, has three methods:
#   * One returns a string which is the concatenation of the strings
#   of the collection, separated with a space
#   * Another one prints out the last element of the collection
#   * The last one returns a three-element array with three random
#   elements
