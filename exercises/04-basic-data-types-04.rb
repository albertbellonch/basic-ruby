# Define a class that takes an array of strings as an instance
# variable. It has to have three methods:
#   * One outputs all the words with size bigger than 5, in
#   alphabetical order
#   * The second one takes a string as a parameter, and returns
#   the number of strings in the array that match the parameter
#   * The third one reads lines from the command line until one
#   matches any word in the array. In that moment, outputs 'DONE'
