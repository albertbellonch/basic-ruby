# Write a class that, given a collection of numbers as an instance
# variable, has three methods:
#   * One returns an array where, for each original number, there
#   is its triple
#   * The other one outputs the index and value of each number, like
#   'Number 4 is 9'
#   * The last one returns an array of the numbers which are greater
#   than 10. You have to use Array#select method.
