# Write a class that takes a string as an instance variable, and
# has two methods:
#   * One outputs the number of words of the string
#   * The second takes a string as a parameter, and outputs
#   "The word 'A' is larger than 'B'. If they are the same size,
#   output 'LOL'.
#   * The third outputs the same word, but one character is upcase,
#   the following one is downcase, and so on.
