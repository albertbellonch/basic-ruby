# Write a class that has three class methods:
#   * The first takes a character name as a parameter, and outputs
#   "CHARACTER is from TV SHOW" (you must use inline IF statements)
#   * The second does the same, but with a case statement
#   * The third does the same but using the hash here defined:
CHARACTER_TV_SHOWS = {
  'Tyrion' => 'A Game of Thrones',
  'Carrie' => 'Homeland',
  'Walter White' => 'Breaking Bad',
  'Hank Moody' => 'Californication',
  'Bubbles' => 'The Wire'
}
